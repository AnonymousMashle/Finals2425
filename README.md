# Routing-Example

I have an angular project that has components named home, about, registration, and profile. My instructor said to add 2 new components, and we should name it Services Component and ServiceDetails Component. 
here's what she instructed in our activity:

1. Services Component
- use a CSS table with the following columns:
     a. Service ID
     b. Service Name
     c. Service Description
     d. Actions - add three links or buttons for 'view', 'edit', and 'delete'

2. ServiceDetails Component
- use a CSS form to provide a detailed description of a specific service. Use appropriate form elements for each input.
     Form should display:
     a. Service ID
     b. Service Name
     c. Service Description 
     d. Service Category
     e. Cost or Price
     f. Buttons - save and cancel

3. Router Outlet
     a. Service Component should be displayed on the left side using a named router.
     b. While Service Details is displayed on the right

can you help me with this activity.
